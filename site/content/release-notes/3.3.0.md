-

## Upgrade notes 

This release is binary compatible with previous releases. 

RDF4J 3.1.x and 3.2.x implicitly included the jackson-core, jackson-databind and jackson-annotations dependencies when using the rdf4j-rio-api maven artifact. In version 3.3.0, these dependencies are explicitly excluded.
Projects relying on this unintended behavior should check if they need to add these jackson dependencies to their build files.
