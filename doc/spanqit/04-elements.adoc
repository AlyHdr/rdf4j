= Elements
SPARQL elements are created using various static factory classes. Most core  elements of a query are created by the static `Spanqit` class:
[source,java]
----
Variable price = Spanqit.var("price");
System.out.println(price.getQueryString());
// ==> ?price

Prefix foaf = Spanqit.prefix("foaf", iri("http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"));
System.out.println(foaf.getQueryString());
// ==> PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>
----
Other factory classes include the `Queries` class mentioned in the previous section, as well as the `Expressions`, `GraphPatterns`, and `Rdf` classes.

TIP: All query elements created by Spanqit implement the `QueryElement` interface, which provides the `getQueryString()` method. This can be used to get the String representing the SPARQL syntax of any element.
