= Introduction
RDF4J SparqlBuilder is a fluent Java API used to programmatically create SPARQL query strings. It is based on the http://https://github.com/anqit/spanqit[Spanqit] query builder developed by Anqit Praqash, and has been slightly modified to allow tighter integration with the rest of the RDF4J framework.

SparqlBuilder allows the following SPARQL query:
[source,sparql]
----
PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>
SELECT ?name
WHERE { ?x foaf:name ?name }
ORDER BY ?name
LIMIT 5
OFFSET 10
----
to be created as simply as:
[source,java]
----
query.prefix(foaf).select(name)
    .where(x.has(foaf.iri("name"), name))
    .orderBy(name)
    .limit(5)
    .offset(10);
----

The RDF4J SparqlBuilder is based on the https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/[SPARQL 1.1 Query Recommendation] and the https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-update/[SPARQL 1.1 Update Receommendation]. Almost all features of SPARQL 1.1 are supported, excluding some current (Known-Limitations)[known limitations].

NOTE: This document assumes the reader is already familiar with the SPARQL query language. Please refer to the above specification if not.
