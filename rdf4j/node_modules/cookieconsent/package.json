So we made it fast, free, and relatively painless.\n\n## Version 3.0\n\nVersion 3.0 is a complete rewrite from version 2. The most substantial new features are:\n\n- the ability to GeoLocate and only show the addon to people in the relevant countries\n- callback hooks for showing/accepting/revoking the banner\n- support for different types of compliance, giving you the flexibility to obey even the strictest cookie laws\n- easy no-fuss themes and customisable styles\n\n## Installation\n\nThe easiest way to get up and running is to use our [wizard](https://cookieconsent.insites.com/download/). \n\nYou can also install this project through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n```sh\nnpm install cookieconsent\n```\n\nOr through [Bower](https://bower.io/):\n\n```sh\nbower install cookieconsent\n```\n\n## Documentation \n\nSee our [full documentation](https://cookieconsent.insites.com/documentation/).\n\n## Contributing\n\nFeel free to improve the plugin and send us a pull request.  \n\nThe easiest way to develop is to host the files with a local webserver. e.g. \n\n```sh\npython -m SimpleHTTPServer\n```\n\nWe use Gulp to compile the SCSS and minify the JavaScript. You can run a build with:\n\n```sh\ngulp build\n```\n\n## License\n\nCode released under the [MIT licence](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n\n## Credits\n\nCookie Consent v3\n\n+ Alex Morley-Finch - JavaScript\n+ Piiu Pilt - JavaScript\n+ Oliver Emberton (@oliveremberton) - a couple of lines of CSS, maybe\n\nCookie Consent v2\n\n+ David Ball (@drball) - CSS / themes\n+ Adam Hutchinson (@adjohu) - JavaScript\n",
